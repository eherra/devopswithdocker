Changes

for docker-compose on backend services

I changed request origin to match since all the request are coming thru that address
REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost:80 


From frontend Dockerfile I took removed:
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=localhost:8080

since it's not needed anymore and the calls are defaulted to /api if the env is missing.
